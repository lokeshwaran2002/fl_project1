Python script that uses the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and the MySQL Connector library for connecting to and inserting data into a MySQL table. Please note that web scraping may be subject to legal and ethical considerations, and it's important to check if the website allows scraping and follow the website's terms of service.


Before running the script, make sure you have installed the required libraries by running pip install requests beautifulsoup4 mysql-connector-python.

Please replace the placeholders your_db_host, your_db_user, your_db_password, your_db_name, and https://example.com/products with your MySQL database credentials and the URL of the website you want to scrape.
Also, adjust the HTML tags and classes used in the scrape_website function according to the actual structure of the website you are scraping.

This script will fetch the product data from the specified website and insert it into a MySQL table named products with columns sku, price, description, and web_link. Make sure to create this table in your MySQL database before running the script.
